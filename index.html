    </p>

    <h4>How to use</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the 'Left' button, then select the toontown window on the left, wait until the multi comes back and make sure it says the name of the toontown process</li>
        <li>Same thing but with right button</li>
        <li>Click the toggle button so it says active, it is now listening to your key presses, wow!</li>
        <li>It is now broadcasting every keypress to both of your toontown processes</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>notes:</strong><br>this isnt restricted to toontown, it will broadcast your keypresses to most windows.
        knowing this, dont use it to broadcast to random processes because idk what could happen lol<br><br>
        this is a very much work in process, this may or may not be the only update depending on how much my interest holds<br>
        I will probably open source it eventually. it's pretty simple but right now everything is really sloppy
