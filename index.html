        Apple is a big meanie and does not like unsigned apps (it needs to be unsigned so it can control other windows)<br>
        When you try to open the app you will get "this app is damaged". To fix it follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FF1c_7lnGo">this video</a><br>
        Dont't worry, this app probably isn't malicious

    <p><strong>notes:</strong><br>this isnt restricted to toontown, it will broadcast your keypresses to most windows.
        knowing this, dont use it to broadcast to random processes because idk what could happen lol<br><br>
        this is a very much work in progress, this may or may not be the only update depending on how much my interest holds<br>
        I will probably open source it eventually. it's pretty simple but right now everything is really ugly and all over the place

    <p>tested with ods and ttr (yes I actually redownloaded ttr just to test this, you're welcome)</p>
